# HotspotCubecell

Monitor and control* your offgrid Helium hotspot over LoRaWAN.

Depends only on battery power and LoRaWAN coverage for its operation, so keeps running even if hotspot is having problems.

* Remotely monitor parameters like temperature and battery state.
* Remotely control* your charge controller to power cycle the hotspot and cell modem.

Hardware used:
* Cubecell HTCC-AB01 dev board and LoRaWAN antenna
* Cubecell HDC-1080 temperature and humidity sensor
* MAX3232 Logic-to-RS232 converter board (for connection to Renogy charge controller)
* 12V to 3.3V step down converter (to power the Cubecell directly off the battery)
 
\* not yet implemented
